Original Program: 

The three folders were created the private_program, boss_file and full_program. The private_program and boss_file were then shown in the github. The .gitignore was created to hide the dataset and the full_program folder. The model was run in the private_program and then the pickle was generated in the private program and were then used later to predict the new sample. Initially there were 3 options as 1 for bad, 2 for average and 3 for good, with this option model was run and pickle was generated, and then different other random forest and logistic regression was done to compare the accuracy. The pickle was later used to the new sample for prediction. The multinomial naive Bayesian model showed a high performance 62% compared to random forest or logistic regression.

New_criteria: 

The three folders were created the private_program, boss_file and full_program. The private_program and boss_file were then shown in the github. The model was run in the private_program and then the pickle was generated in the private program and were then used later to predict the new sample. There were 2 options as, 1 for bad and 2 for good, with this option model was run and pickle was generated. The pickle was later used to the new sample for prediction. 

I compared the predicted csv and the initial shows a better compared to the later. It is because it has 3 options before as later has just 2 options.
